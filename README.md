# Installing Youtube Popup Blocker Extension in Chrome

1. Click the three dots (menu icon) in the top right corner of the Chrome window to open the menu.

2. In the menu, go to "Settings."

3. In the left sidebar of the Settings page, locate and click on "Extensions."

4. You'll be directed to the "Extensions" page. At the top right of the page, enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch to the right.

5. Once Developer mode is enabled, you'll have additional options available.

6. On the left side of the "Extensions" page, you should see the "Load Unpacked" button. Click on it.

7. A file dialog will open, allowing you to select the directory where you've cloned or stored your Youtube Popup Blocker extension.

8. Navigate to and select the directory of your extension, and then click the "Open" or "Select Folder" button, depending on your system.

9. Chrome will load and install the extension from the selected directory.

10. Your custom extension should now be added to Chrome, and you can manage its settings or use it as needed.

11. If you want to make changes to the extension's script or code, simply click the "Reload" button in the extension card on the "Extensions" page. This will refresh the extension and apply any script file modifications.

That's it! Open youtube, open developer options and read extension messages. :-)
